# Weekly Review Workflow

This workflow helps summarize what happened this week and plan priorities for next week.

## Steps

1. **Gather Context**
   Review recent activity:
   - Check completed tasks and deliverables
   - Note any blockers or challenges encountered
   - Identify wins and progress made

2. **Summarize the Week**
   Create a brief summary covering:
   - What got done
   - What didn't get done (and why)
   - Key decisions made
   - Lessons learned

3. **Identify Priorities**
   Look ahead to next week:
   - What are the top 3 priorities?
   - Are there any upcoming deadlines?
   - What resources or inputs are needed?

4. **Flag Blockers**
   Note anything that might slow progress:
   - Waiting on someone else?
   - Need a decision from leadership?
   - Missing information or tools?

5. **Provide Output**
   Format as a simple weekly report the user can share or reference.
