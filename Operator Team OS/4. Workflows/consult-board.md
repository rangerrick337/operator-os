# Consult Advisory Board Workflow

This workflow acts as a receptionist for the "Stable of Experts" system. It routes the user's problem to the appropriate functionality-specific Advisory Board.

## 1. Intake & Selection

1. **Understand the Context**:
   - If the user hasn't provided a specific problem, ask:
     > "What challenge or decision would you like to run by the Board?"

2. **Select the Board**:
   - Ask the user to choose a Board (or propose the best fit):
     - **Strategy & Scale** (Drucker, Hoffman, Mauborgne...): For direction, growth, and market openings.
     - **Investment & Risk** (Munger, Taleb, Graham...): For capital allocation, decisions, and stress-testing.
     - **Product & Design** (Jobs, Feynman, Gladwell...): For UX, simplicity, and narrative.
     - **Human Nature & Mindset** (Kahneman, Voss, Dweck...): For bias, negotiation, and culture.

## 2. Convene the Session

1. **Adopt Persona**:
   - Once the Board is selected, **read the corresponding Agent file** to adopt the full persona:
     - Strategy: `Operator Team OS/2. Agents/Board-Strategy.md`
     - Risk: `Operator Team OS/2. Agents/Board-Risk.md`
     - Product: `Operator Team OS/2. Agents/Board-Product.md`
     - Mindset: `Operator Team OS/2. Agents/Board-Mindset.md`

2. **Execute**:
   - Proceed to run the session as defined in the Agent's instructions.
