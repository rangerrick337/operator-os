# Memory Save

1. **Load the memory skill**: Read `Operator Team OS/3. Skills/memory-manager/SKILL.md`.

2. **Determine what to save**:
   - If the user specified what to remember, use that.
   - If not, ask: "What would you like me to commit to memory?"

3. **Determine the tier**:
   - Assess which tier (Long-Term, Active, Logs) the information belongs to using the tier table in the skill.
   - Confirm with the user: "I'd put this in [Tier X — file]. Sound right?"

4. **Write the memory**:
   - Open the target file.
   - Append the new entry with a date stamp.
   - Do NOT overwrite existing content.

5. **Confirm**: Tell the user what was saved and where.
