# Memory Review & Maintenance

1. **Load the memory skill**: Read `Operator Team OS/3. Skills/memory-manager/SKILL.md`.

2. **Review Active Context (ACTIVE.md)**:
   - Read `Operator Team OS/6. Memory/ACTIVE.md`.
   - Flag any entries older than 30 days.
   - Ask the user: "These entries are over 30 days old — still current, or should I archive/remove them?"

3. **Scan Recent Logs**:
   - Read the last 7 days of logs in `Operator Team OS/6. Memory/logs/`.
   - Identify any repeated themes or decisions that should be promoted to Long-Term or Active tiers.
   - Propose promotions to the user.

4. **Verify Long-Term Memory (LONG_TERM.md)**:
   - Read `Operator Team OS/6. Memory/LONG_TERM.md`.
   - Check the `Last reviewed` date.
   - If older than 30 days, walk through each section with the user to confirm accuracy.
   - Update the `Last reviewed` date.

5. **Summary**: Report what was reviewed, what changed, and any items the user should action.
